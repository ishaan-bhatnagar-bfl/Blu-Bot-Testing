## Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18 or higher — [download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** — [download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- Access to the BLU UAT environment (mobile number + OTP bypass code — get from Ishaan Bhatnagar)
- Data files (see [Data Setup](#data-setup)) — obtain from Ishaan Bhatnagar

Check your Node version:
```bash
node --version
# Should print v18.x.x or higher
```

---

## First-Time Setup

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ishaan-bhatnagar-bfl/Blu-Bot---UAT-Testing.git
cd CAI
```

### 2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
npx playwright install chromium
```

### 3. Create your config file

```bash
cp run_config.json.example run_config.json
```

Open `run_config.json` and fill in your credentials:

```json
{
  "BLU_URL": "https://bflaiassist-uat.bajajfinserv.in/blu/?jid=blu",
  "BLU_MOBILE": "xxxxxxxxxx",
  "BLU_OTP": "123465",
  "BATCH_SIZE": 20,
  "FILTER_MODULE": "",
  "DELAY_BETWEEN_MSGS_MS": 2000,
  "BOT_REPLY_TIMEOUT_MS": 45000
}
```

> `run_config.json` is gitignored — never committed. Never share your OTP bypass code over email or Slack.

---

## Data Setup

Place the following files in the `data/` folder. None are committed to the repo (gitignored).

| File | Required for | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `3IN1 CHAT DATA DUMP.csv` | v4/v5/v6 generator (old bot utterances) | Ishaan Bhatnagar |
| `Chat Dump_9_10_May.xlsx` | v5/v6 generator (new bot sessions) | Ishaan Bhatnagar |
| `Loan Knowledge Repository version-1.1.xlsx` | v5/v6 generator (KB merge) | Ishaan Bhatnagar |
| `Insurance Knowledge Repository version 1.1 1.xlsx` | v5 generator only | Ishaan Bhatnagar |

---

## Generating Test Cases

Run once before testing, or whenever JSONs or data files are updated.

### v6 (recommended — most accurate)

```bash
node scripts/generate_test_cases_v6.js
```

Uses utterance-to-KB-question matching (primary) + bot reply validation (secondary). Skips fallback-only sessions. Output: `data/blu_test_cases_v6.json`

### v5 (session-level mapping)

```bash
node scripts/generate_test_cases_v5.js
```

Uses bot reply → KB answer matching. Output: `data/blu_test_cases_v5.json`

### v4 (keyword mapping, old CSV only)

```bash
node scripts/generate_test_cases_v4.js
```

Output: `data/blu_test_cases_v4.json`

> Note: The test file `tests/blu_v4.test.js` reads from whichever JSON is specified. Update the `allCases` path in the test file to switch between v4/v5/v6.

---

## Running Tests

### Basic run (your module, batch of 20)

```bash
FILTER_MODULE="EMI_Card_Service" BATCH_SIZE=20 npx playwright test tests/blu_v4.test.js
```

### Run a specific L2

```bash
FILTER_MODULE="EMI_Card_Service" FILTER_L2="EMI Network Card" BATCH_SIZE=20 npx playwright test tests/blu_v4.test.js
```

### Run without module filter

```bash
BATCH_SIZE=20 npx playwright test tests/blu_v4.test.js
```

> Results are saved after every test case — partial results are preserved even if the run crashes.

---

## Module Filter Reference

## Understanding Results

After each run, two files are created in `results/`:

```
results/
  run_2026-05-12T10-30-00.json   ← full structured data
  run_2026-05-12T10-30-00.csv    ← open in Excel / Google Sheets
```

### CSV Columns

| Column | Description |
|---|---|
| TC ID | Unique test case ID |
| Module | Module tag |
| L1 / L2 / L3 | Category hierarchy |
| Utterance | Query sent to bot |
| Bot Reply | Full bot response (up to 1000 chars) |
| Expected Key Phrases | Phrases bot should mention |
| Matched Phrases | Phrases actually found |
| CTA Expected | Whether a CTA was expected |
| CTA Found | Whether a CTA was detected |
| Overall | Pass / Fail / Manual Review |
| Reason | Why it failed |
| Follow-up Rounds | Multi-turn follow-up count |
| Time (ms) | Response time |
| Mapping Type | `new_dump` / `old_csv` / `kb_verbatim` |
| Mapping Confidence | 0–100 match score |
| Scoring Type | `auto` or `manual` |

### Overall Values

- **Pass** — bot replied with expected content and CTA
- **Fail** — wrong answer, error, or missing CTA
- **Manual Review** — dynamic/relational answer; human must verify Bot Reply column

---

## How Scoring Works

### Auto scoring (static answers)
1. Extract key phrases from KB answer (CTA label, core instructions)
2. Check bot reply contains at least 1 key phrase
3. Check CTA present if expected
4. Both pass → **Pass**

### Manual Review (dynamic/relational answers)
KB answer references `customer_data` (EMI amounts, loan status, account details). Bot reply is logged; human reviews.

### Mapping types
- `new_dump` — from new bot sessions, confidence ≥ 30 — most reliable
- `new_dump_low_confidence` — from new bot sessions, confidence < 30 — treat with caution
- `old_csv` — from old bot CSV, confidence ≥ 30
- `old_csv_low_confidence` — old CSV, confidence < 30
- `kb_verbatim` — KB question used directly — highest reliability for scoring

---

## Troubleshooting

**"0 test cases matched filters"**

Check spelling of `FILTER_MODULE`:
```bash
node -e "const c=require('./data/blu_test_cases_v6.json'); console.log([...new Set(c.map(t=>t.module))].sort().join('\n'))"
```

**"data/blu_test_cases_v6.json not found"**

Run the generator first: `node scripts/generate_test_cases_v6.js`

**Consent screen not clearing**

Script handles consent automatically during login. If it loops, restart the run.

**Bot says "no active relation"**

UAT account relations may have been reset. Contact Ishaan Bhatnagar to restore UAT relations.

**OTP validation fails / Retry card appears during login**

Script retries up to 5 times. If it still fails, UAT server may be down — try again in a few minutes.

**Push to GitHub fails with 403**

Corporate and home networks block git push. Use mobile hotspot. If still failing:
```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "unblock push"
git push
git reset HEAD~1
git push --force
```

```

### When JSONs are updated

```bash
node scripts/generate_test_cases_v6.js
FILTER_MODULE="YOUR_MODULE" BATCH_SIZE=5 npx playwright test tests/blu_v4.test.js
```

### Switching test case version

In `tests/blu_v4.test.js`, line ~19:
```javascript
const allCases = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(path.resolve('data/blu_test_cases_v6.json'), 'utf-8'));
```
Change `v6` to `v5` or `v4` as needed.

### Commit checklist

```bash
git add scripts/ tests/ playwright.config.js run_config.json.example README.md
git commit -m "your message"
# Use mobile hotspot for push if on corporate/home network
git push
```
